### Resident Evil 4 - Autosplitter

This is an auto splitter which removes most loading screens in the game. This is not the first load remover for RE4, but were hoping it will be the last one. Here are some brief notes on the differences between this new timer and the old one:

- Removes all loading screens for the inventory, merchant menus, and tutorial screens.
- Compensates for dropped frames throughout the run. If you drop frames at any point, the timer will automatically compensate for that lost time at the end of each room.
- Unlike the old timer, this one will not pause in between chapters.

Like the last timer, this one will always start on its own upon gaining control of Leon or Ada, and will split upon initiating the last cutscene after the jet ski section (or getting the rocket as Ada in SW or calling the helicopter in AA). It will also reset on its own upon going back to the main menu, in order to prevent being used in segmented runs.

To clarify for those who do not know: this timer is NOT the same as the games in-game timer. The IGT for RE4 never pauses during load screens and does not compensate for frame drops, which makes it unviable for speed running on PC, where hardware differences can give people a massive advantage.

**A brief tutorial on how to use the timer:**

1. Put Resident Evil 4 (Steam) as the game name in LiveSplit.
2. Choose to activate the auto splitter, if you are connected to the internet it should come up on its own.
3. Go to “Settings,” which should be next to the “Activate” option.
4. From here you will see many boxes you will be able to check out. These are your options for how the timer will function. Make sure that the the “Load Remover & Framecount Timer” option at the bottom is always checked.
5. After this, you can fill whatever options you want. Filling out the “Doorsplit” option will make it so that the timer will split on the doors on the category you have chosen (Either Normal/Pro for the Main Game, Separate Ways, or Assignment Ada).
6. Also, make sure that you are **ALWAYS comparing to game time** in LiveSplit.
